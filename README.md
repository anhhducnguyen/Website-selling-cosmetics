## Overview
The cosmetic industry is rapidly growing, and creating an online store provides an excellent opportunity for businesses to reach a broader audience. This project focuses on building a user-friendly and visually appealing website to sell cosmetic products while providing customers with a seamless shopping experience.

- Provide search and filter tools for customers to easily find products by price, brand, or type.

### Shopping Cart and Payment:
- Allow customers to manage their shopping cart efficiently, adding/removing products and editing quantities.
- Offer secure and convenient payment methods such as credit cards, bank transfers, and cash on delivery.

### Interaction and Feedback:
- Offer live chat support to quickly assist customers with their questions or concerns.
- Enable customers to rate and review products, boosting trust and credibility.

### Content and News:
- Provide engaging content like product usage guides, beauty tips, and news about cosmetics.

This UI/UX design plan will create a seamless and engaging experience for online shoppers, making it easy for them to find, review, and purchase cosmetic products.
